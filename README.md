# VITAL

This project was made by students of Concordia University Wisconsin. Its intent was to be a way of gaining extended exposure to development within Unity3D in 
virtual reality development. We made this project for the Nursing Department to give them a way to practive building muscle memory outside of a nursing lab environment, to accellerate students' ability to learning nursing skills.
