/*  ============ Loading up Supply Room =============
 *  This is the main start-up script for the Supply Room. 
 *  The steps that occur are as follows: 
 *      1. All needed GameObjects are located and assigned to their appropriate variables.
 *      2. Game data is loaded in from the save file.
 *      3. The currLevel and nextLevel are set. This is important for when the player moves into the Score Room 
 *         (after completing or committing too many mistakes).
 *      4. The selected difficulty's values are assigned.
