/*  ============ Loading up Score Room =============
 *  This is the main start-up script for the Score Room. 
 *  The steps that occur are as follows: 
 *      1. All needed GameObjects are located and assigned to their appropriate variables.
 *      2. The player's points & strikes are displayed on the ScoreUI.
 *      3. If the Supply Room has not been completed successfully, the player will be unable to proceed to next level.
