/*  ============= NextLevel =============
 *  This script allows the player to move from the Score Room to the next one.
 *  The Score Room's job is to act as a middle-man between skills. 
 *      1. All needed Objects are located and assigned to their appropriate variables.
 *      2. When the player interacts with the chalk on the blackboard tray, the player will procede to the next level
 *         If the player has not successfully completed the previous level/room, they will
